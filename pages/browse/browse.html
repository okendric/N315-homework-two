                Johnny Test is a great show about a boy who goes on a lot of
                adventures with his dog. He has 2 genius twin sisters that
                create a lot of tech and gadgets that he tends to "borrow".

                Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of the greatest shows in my
                opinion. It starts out with a boy named Aang who wields several
                different abilities: earth, fire, water, energy, and air.

                Looney Tunes is a classic for many people. There's a rabbit
                named Bugs Bunny who stars in a lot of episodes. There's also a
                small yellow bird named Tweety that's pretty popular.

                Mickey Mouse is another classic. He's featured in various shows
                and movies. He has a wife named "Minnie Mouse" that looks just
                life a female version of himself.

                Phineas and Ferb was one of my favorite childhood shows growing
                up. These brothers get into all sorts of adventures. Their
                platipus is a secret agent, which the boys are unaware of (99%
                of the time).

                Scooby-Doo is a fun family cartoon to watch. It's been around

                The Simpsons is a great show to watch whenever you need a laugh.
                Bart gets into a lot of trouble, Homer doesn't know what he's
                doing half the time, and Lisa loves playing her saxophone.

                The Smurfs is another fun show to watch with family or friends.
                The smurfs all look identical, but they have different skill
                sets! Clumsy is one that tends to get me laughing a lot.

                Spongebob is a show that is watched by many. There's so many
                episodes and fun moments that happen within the episodes. I'd be
                surprised if you haven't heard of this show at least once.

                Tom and Jerry is a fun classic show. It involved Tom, a cat,
                trying to always stop Jerry, a mouse, at doing whatever
                mischievous thing that he decides to do.
